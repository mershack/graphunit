A1GLF2427E02YG		I had trouble with selecting the ingredients connected. It took a few times for me to figure out I just had to mouse over the ingredients on the top row until I was over the black square. I was trying to highlight the square and then move up and select the ingredient. Once I figured it out it wasn't too hard. However, the pan feature does not work well. If the ingredient highlighted is near the bottom of the table, I wish I could highlight the connection and then scroll the table to select the top ingredient (if that makes sense). I think scroll would work well with this. I also think you should put in the instructions in this page that you can't copy/paste your ID into it or it won't let you submit. Thanks!		 : MAT : NL		1366		643		notRecorded		1.0,0.8,0.5216666666666667		4.2,12.0,24.1		12,29,3,74,45,7,73,42		Sat Dec 05 2015 09:58:29 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)
